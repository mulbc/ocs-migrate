# pvc-migrate

## Overview

`pvc-migrate` automates migration of PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and PersistentVolumes (PVs) from OCP 3.x to OCP 4.x.

### Prerequisite steps

* The application on the source side needs to be quiesced before attempting migration
* PVs to be migrated need to be attached with pods, unattached PVs will not be migrated
* SSH Connection to 3.x Clusters need to be configured - [Instructions](./docs/inventory-notes.md)
* Storage Class Selections must be made - [Instructions](./docs/sc-selection.md)

## Usage

### 1. Clone this git repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konveyor/pvc-migrate && cd pvc-migrate
git checkout <version>
```

### 2. Automation prerequisites

#### Virtualenv

* Installing Virtualenv

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv env
```

* Activate Virtualenv and install requirements

```bash
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Install selinux dependency if selinux is enabled

```bash
pip install selinux
```

* To update any requirements

```bash
pip freeze &> requirements.txt
```

#### Without Virtualenv

```bash
pip3 install ansible==2.9.7 --user      # ansible 2.9
pip3 install kubernetes==11.0.0 --user  # kubernetes module for ansible
pip3 install openshift==0.11.2 --user   # openshift module for ansible
pip3 install PyYAML==5.1.1 --user       # pyyaml module for python
pip3 install jmespath==0.10.0 --user    # for json querying from ansible
pip3 install urllib3==1.24.2 --user     # stage 1 requirement

sudo dnf install jq                     # jq-1.6 for json processing
sudo dnf install bind-utils
sudo dnf install dnsutils
sudo dnf install python3-libselinux
```

### 3. Set cluster authentication details

**Copy source and destination cluster KUBECONFIG files authenticated with  *cluster-admin* privileges to `auth` directory**

   1. Create `auth` directory inside of repository root: `mkdir auth`

   1. Copy source cluster kubeconfig to `auth/KUBECONFIG_SRC`

   1. Copy destination cluster kubeconfig to `auth/KUBECONFIG_TARGET`

### 4. Set list of namespaces to migrate PVC data for

   1. Copy sample config file as starting point: `cp 1_pvc_data_gen/vars/pvc-data-gen.yml.example 1_pvc_data_gen/vars/pvc-data-gen.yml`

   1. Edit `1_pvc_data_gen/vars/pvc-data-gen.yml` , adding list of namespaces for which PV/PVC data should be migrated

```yaml
namespaces_to_migrate:
 - rocket-chat
 - nginx-pv
```

### 5. Familiarize with PVC migration automation

The `pvc-migrate` tooling is designed to work in 3 stages :

#### Stage 1 - Detect source cluster info (PVCs, Pods, Nodes) ([Stage 1 README](1_pvc_data_gen))

`1_pvc_data_gen`

This preliminary stage collects information about PVCs, PVs and Pods from the Source cluster. It creates a JSON report of collected data which will be consumed by subsequent stages.

**Note**: changes to the source cluster after completion of Stage 1 will not be considered by next stages. You can re-run stage 1 to refresh data as needed before running Stages 2 and 3.

#### Stage 2 - Migrate PVC definitions to destination cluster ([Stage 2 README](2_pvc_destination_gen))

`2_pvc_destination_gen`

This stage translates and migrates PVC resource definitions from the source to the destination cluster.

**Note**: after completion of this stage, you will have PVCs created on the destination cluster which _may_ or _may not_ be `Bound` . This is expected as some provisioners do not create PVs until PVCs are bound to pods. This stage __requires__ users to provide Storage Class selections for the destination cluster. Please see notes on [Storage Class Selection](./docs/sc-selection.md)

#### Stage 3 - RSync PVC data to destination cluster ([Stage 3 README](3_run_rsync))

`3_run_rsync`

This final stage launches pods to attach with the PVCs created in the previous stage.

* Each PVC is attached to its own dummy pod. The pods have `rsync` and `ssh` installed.
* The tooling then uses `rsync` from source side to sync files to the PVs mounted on Pods in the destination side.

*Note*: This stage __requires__ users to provide node info on the source cluster. Please see notes on [Configuring SSH and Inventory for Stage 3](./docs/inventory-notes.md)

### 6. Running the PVC migration

1. Run steps in: [1_pvc_data_gen/README.md](1_pvc_data_gen)
1. Run steps in: [2_pvc_destination_gen/README.md](2_pvc_destination_gen)
1. Run steps in: [3_run_rsync/README.md](3_run_rsync)

### 7. Run CAM in "no PVC migration" mode

   1. Your PV/PVC data has been migrated. You can use CAM to migrate the remaining OpenShift resources, which will connect to the PV/PVC data created by this tool.
   2. To run CAM in "no PVC migration" mode, modify the `MigrationController` resource on the *destination cluster* by swapping out the mig-controller image, then execute a migration as usual. The PVC migration steps will be skipped, but all other resources will be migrated, and workloads will connect back to the newly provisioned PVCs..

      ```bash
      oc edit MigrationController -n openshift-migration
      ```

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: migration.openshift.io/v1alpha1
      kind: MigrationController
      metadata:
      name: migration-controller
      namespace: openshift-migration
      spec:
      [...]
      mig_controller_image_fqin: quay.io/konveyor/mig-controller:release-1.2.2-hotfix-nopvs
      [...]
      ```

   3. Create a MigPlan and MigMigration covering the same namespaces migrated with `pvc-migrate`.
